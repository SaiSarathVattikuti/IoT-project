# IoT-project
# Abstract
An accident may lead to large number of deaths of many workers. A warning system is capable of detecting the non-safe conditions in the coalmine. In this project, we intend to create a reliable communication system and a safety monitor which checks various parameter in coal mines such as temperature, humidity, methane gas and vibrations by using respective sensors. The sensor values are collected by the Atmega 2560 and are transmitted to the base station using the Zigbee transceivers. In the base station Raspberry pi receives the data and this data is uploaded to the cloud. We have also included closed loop control mechanism so that the threshold values of sensors can be changed from the control station.  
Keywords: Atmega 2560, closed loop control mechanism, Raspberry Pi, sensor, Zigbee transceivers.
